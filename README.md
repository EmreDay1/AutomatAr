# AutomatAR

Mechanical systems are fundamental to engineering and robotics, yet many K-12 students struggle to bridge the gap between theoretical
knowledge and practical application. In order to bridge this gap and allow them to apply the necessary skill sets that are embedded within STEM
areas we created the Automata Kits, covering areas from 3D design, mechanics, to augmented reality. Mechanical systems or figures that mimic
any motion found in nature, especially human motions, continue to entertain us and capture our imagination. We created a bridge between
mechanics and technology by integrating our kits with augmented reality (AR). Our kits consist of eight models, each reflecting a fundamental
mechanical principle such as gears, cams and crank systems. These models, which are designed and 3D printed by us, and the research towards it
develops a better understanding in mechanical systems and creates interest when integrating augmented reality (AR) elements. This dual
integration of AR aims to create more interactivity and enhance comprehension, particularly in complex mechanical systems.
